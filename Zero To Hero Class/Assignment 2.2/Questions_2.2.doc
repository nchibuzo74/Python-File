2. Write a program that uses a for loop to print numbers from 10 down to 1. 
3. Use a for loop to print all even numbers between 1 and 20 (inclusive). 
4. Use a while loop to print all odd numbers between 1 and 15 (inclusive). 
5. Write a program that repeatedly asks the user for a number until they enter 0. After they enter 
0, print the sum of all the numbers they entered (excluding the 0). 
6. Write a Python program that prints all the numbers from 0 to 6 except 3 and 6. 
Note : Use 'continue' statement. 
7. Write a Python program to get the Fibonacci series between 0 and 50. 
8. Write a Python program that accepts a word from the user and reverses it. 
10. Write a Python program to print the alphabet pattern 'E'.

11. Write a Python function that accepts two integers as arguments and sums  two integers. 
However, if the sum is between 15 and 20 it will return 20 
12. Write a Python program to calculate a dog's age in dog years. 
Note: For the first two years, a dog year is equal to 10.5 human years. After that, each dog year 
equals 4 human years. 
14. Write a Python program to count the number of even and odd numbers in a series of 
numbers 
Sample numbers : numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)  
15. Write a Python function to sum all the numbers in a list. 
Sample List : (8, 2, 3, 0, 7) 
16. Write a Python function that takes a number as a parameter and checks whether the 
number is prime or not. 
Note : A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 and that has no positive 
divisors other than 1 and itself. 
17. Write a Python program to access a function inside a function.
