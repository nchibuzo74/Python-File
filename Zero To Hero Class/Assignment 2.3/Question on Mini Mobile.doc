Create a Python program that simulates a mini mobile app with the following superhero features:

        Recharge your phone number with any network (MTN, Glo, Airtel, 9mobile – yes, no discrimination here 😄).

        Share airtime with friends, family, or that one cousin who always asks at the worst time.

        Share mobile data too—because sharing is caring, right?

Bonus Points if:

    Your app has menus or prompts that feel like a real user interface.

    You handle “invalid input” like a pro (even if someone tries to recharge with ₦5 million 😅).

    You add a bit of fun to your messages/output (think: "You just recharged like a boss!" 💸)
